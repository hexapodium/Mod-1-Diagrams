# UK motorcycle test Mod 1 scale drawing

## what

This is an interpretation of the [DVSA standard motorcycle maneuvering area](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/motorcycle-manoeuvring-area-diagrams) based on the dimensions specified in page 3 of "Motorcycle Maneuvering Area: multi-purpose test centre". It's drawn from scratch in vector graphics, at a nominal 1:100 scale, so you can blow it up as big as you like. Colours are a rough match for those used in the DVSA diagrams. Maneuvers and gridlines are on separate layers, and each logical group of cones is grouped together.

This is not a replacement for the DVSA documents, which show additional detail (like all the maneuvers listed in order). 

## why

The DVSA-supplied diagrams aren't to scale, which is confusing: they show the curve as being much smaller than it actually is, and compress a lot of the scale of the avoidance maneuver. More generally they just don't match up between what they look like and the real world. Hopefully these drawings fix that. 

As well, the DVSA dimensional drawing is very confused, with lots of "maybe these are meant to be coaxial/parallel" issues and having to work through three or four dimensions to find a measurement between two adjacent cones. 

## issues

The specification for the MMA isn't fully dimensionally constrained, particularly in terms of whether the main curve (20/30mph circuits) is meant to be a perfect radius or not. Some cone spacings are not well-defined in general. 

## future

Drawings of "avoidance to left" and "avoidance to right" diagrams, which are similar but not identical to the MPTC. This might wither on the vine since no dimensions at all are specified for these test layouts, although presumably they share most common elements. 

If Mod 1 changes, obviously all bets are off. I'll probably catch up eventually. 

## contact / contribution

Forks and pull requests very welcome, I'm sure I've overlooked something. If you're from the DVSA and have any improvements to offer, please do open an issue or get in touch (or fix it yourself and pull request, naturally)
